# Visual Studio Code User Preferences

The purpose of this repository is to track and manage my Visual Studio Code user preferences. These include snippets that I crafted over the years of developing with Visual Studio Code and JavaScript in general.

It also provides a way to backup my user preferences and keep all my preferences consistent across all multiple platforms i.e Mac OSX and Windows 10
